1. We created a class called SavedGame with four properties: a
string to store the name of the player’s location, a Dictionary with
opponent names as the key and their hiding place location names
as the value, a List of found opponent names, and move number.

2. We add a unit test that hid opponents in specific locations in the
house, called ParseInput to play the game and find some of them,
and then called ParseInput to save the game to a temporary file.
Then it creates a new GameController and calls ParseInput to load
the game from the temporary file, and checks various values to
make sure the game was loaded. Then we delete the temporary file.

3. We added a unit test to make sure the game does not allow
filenames that included slashes or spaces (to prevent accidentally
overwriting important system files).

4. We updated GameController to parse the load and save
commands and added the code that loads and saves the game,
using JsonSerializer to serialize and deserialize the SavedGame
class to a file in the current execution folder.
